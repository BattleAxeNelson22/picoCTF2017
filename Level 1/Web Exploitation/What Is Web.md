# What is Web - 20 PTS
Someone told me that some guy came up with the "World Wide Web", using "HTML" and "stuff". Can you help me figure out what that is? Website.

## Hint
How can you figure out how the webpage is actually built?

# Write Up
Go to the website. Theres several differnt ways to look at a website and this Writeup will cover 3 to collect the flag.

First right click the background of the webpage and select "View Source." View source gives you the raw HTML file the page is built on, here you'll find the first flag commented out in the HTML file.

Theres a couple of links on the source page that are going to make the rest of this flag easier. Click the hacker.css, the css file tells the browser how the page is to be presented. Within the css you'll find the second flag.

Head back over to the source and check out the other links, theres a cat.jpg, that takes you to the picture of the cat, but theres also a script.js, the script.js is associated with the button on the web page. Click script.js to view the script and find the last piece of the flag.
