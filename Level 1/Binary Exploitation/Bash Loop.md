# Bash Loop - 40 PTS
We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numbers... Go to /problems/e3f1970eb419b3aa32788a43ec91ef08 and try it out!

## Hint
Either use SSH or use the Web Shell to get onto the shell server and navigate to the correct directory. Then do a quick Google search on 'bash loops'. You may need to use grep to filter out the responses as well!

# Write Up
Change Directory to /problems/f8fc794974ad619254d983bc423608c6, from the terminal.

`cd /problems/e3f1970eb419b3aa32788a43ec91ef0`

once here list contents of the directory

`ls`

you should see bashloop, run it

`./bashloop`

>What number am I thinking of? It is between 0 and 4096 

You could try all 4096 examples, or we could use a bash loop. Here's a single line command that will get you the flag, an explanation is provided below:

`for i in {0..4096}; do ./bashloop "$i"; done | grep flag`

Instead of trying every number, youre telling the console to do every number automatically. First define i as every number between 0 and 4096

`for i in {0..4096}`

Now i is 4097 different numnbers, including 0. Now tell command to run the bashloop command with every 'i' variable as the argument, then you have to tell the shell youre done writing the bash loop with "done".

`for i in {0..4096}; do ./bashloop "$i"; done`

You could run this and watch the console try every combination, or we could pipe to our handy dandy grep!

`for i in {0..4096}; do ./bashloop "$i"; done | grep flag`

Piping to grep means taking everything prior to the pipe(|) and inserting as an argument into the next command. So we're going to search the output for "flag"

Give the script a couple of seconds and you'll be rewarded with the flag!

>Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: 9960332950d7db392f97f29dee04f4ee
