The challenge is to decipher the text by using substitition. Substitution is a crypotgaphic method of consistently changing one letter to another. So 'M' could actually be 'T' and 'T' could actually be 'E'. Thats just an example. For this challenge we need to find out what letters have substituted for what other letters. The simplest thing to do would be to follow the hint, and just look for a website that does this for us. 

Google will give you a few options including quipquip, which may do the job for you. Personally QuipQuip gave me enough of the solution for me to figure out the answer on my own but I actually had complete success with a german website: https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver

After pasting in the text from the challenge and hitting solve, the first sentance gives me the flag:

if only it was this easy, well we'll learn shortly it isn't. Congrats on getting the flag!
