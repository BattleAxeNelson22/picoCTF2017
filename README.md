# PicoCTF2017
Welcome to my write-up of the PICOCTF2017.

## About Me:
This is my first CTF, i got through level 1 and decided that the best way for me to actually retain what I had just learned was to do this write up. I went as detailed as I possibly could, so this should be helpful for anyone who's going through this CTF for the first time.

## Before you start:
You can probably do everything in this CTF with a basic Windows computer. How to do everything in this CTF with a basic Windows computer is not the goal of this write up, I don't know how to do that. Here's a few resources I would highly recommend prior to getting started, each of these are free.

1. PuTTY: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
2. Oracle Virtual Box: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
3. Kali Linux: https://www.kali.org/downloads/
4. mRemoteNG: https://mremoteng.org/download
5. WireShark: https://www.wireshark.org/#download
6. WinSCP: https://winscp.net/eng/download.php

In the future I may put together details on installing these and having a decent CTF environment, but in the meantime I'd highly recommend setting up the environment in Tony Robinson's PDF: https://www.blindseeker.com/AVATAR/AVATAR-4-10-17.pdf
